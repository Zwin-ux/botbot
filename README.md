Bot Bot goal is to have a really engaging LLM that will use the same tech as we work on sunny

The goal for all products under bonelli is to have a open LLM feature to ensure that when you are using these products you still have the choice botbot will be a bot that will be able to roleplay and act as characters/peope and perform actions that exceed for regular discord bots (This will also be avaible on the phone/slack soon!)

the goal is having a bot running that will interact with you in a engaging way, to be able to 
-Engage and remember you in active text chats
-Persistent memory cross platform
